Charging Basics

Glossary: 


EVSE: Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment or also known as an EV charging station. 
Ports or Plugs: The plug on the end of the cable that connects the EV charger to the 
vehicle. Ports frequently refers to the number of plugs on a charging station.
Cable: The cable that connects the vehicle to the charging station. 
kW: A common electrical unit of power - 1,000 watts. 
kWh: A kilowatt-hour is the unit of energy over time. One kWh is equal to 1,000 watts of 
power for one hour of time. A microwave oven or a hair dryer use about one kW. But not 
typically for an hour at a time. This is the energy the vehicle uses instead of gasoline. 
Electrical Panel: Contains circuit breakers and distributes electricity throughout the 
building through electrical wiring. 
Conduit: Steel or aluminum tubing used to route and protect electrical wiring. 
EVs: A full Battery Electric or a Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle driven by an electric motor 
with power from the battery. The battery is primarily charged by a charging station. 
BEVs: Battery Electric Vehicles that are only powered by electricity. (All Kabisa vehicles 
are BEVs)
PHEVs: Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles with both a gasoline engine and a large battery 
that can be plugged in to recharge
Range or All Electric Range (AER): The distance that an EV can travel on a full charge.
