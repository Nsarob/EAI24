KABISA CHARGING OPTIONS


Charging Basics
Glossary: 
* EVSE: Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment or also known as an EV charging station. 
* Ports or Plugs: The plug on the end of the cable that connects the EV charger to the vehicle. Ports frequently refers to the number of plugs on a charging station.
* Cable: The cable that connects the vehicle to the charging station. 
* kW: A common electrical unit of power - 1,000 watts. 
* kWh: A kilowatt-hour is the unit of energy over time. One kWh is equal to 1,000 watts of power for one hour of time. A microwave oven or a hair dryer use about one kW. But not typically for an hour at a time. This is the energy the vehicle uses instead of gasoline. 
* Electrical Panel: Contains circuit breakers and distributes electricity throughout the building through electrical wiring. 
* Conduit: Steel or aluminum tubing used to route and protect electrical wiring. 
* EVs: A full Battery Electric or a Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle driven by an electric motor with power from the battery. The battery is primarily charged by a charging station. 
* BEVs: Battery Electric Vehicles that are only powered by electricity. (All Kabisa vehicles are BEVs)
* PHEVs: Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles with both a gasoline engine and a large battery that can be plugged in to recharge
* Range or All Electric Range (AER): The distance that an EV can travel on a full charge.

So the R10 is ready to work more days every month.
It is a new era for clean, reliable public transport in Rwanda. Welcome aboard the R10 Rumuri Electric Bus!
Features
World Class Battery
R10 is powered by 280kWh battery from CATL, the global leader in EV batteries. This
state-of-the-art battery
is certified to the highest international safety standards and backed by an 8-year / 600,000km warranty.
Enhanced Driver Experience

smart digital dashboard lets drivers  monitor all systems
, including complete visibility inside and outside the bus through 5 CCTV cameras.
A Tap-and-Go Electric Bus
R10 passengers board with the familiar convenience of
Tap-and-Go payment systems
. With the same tap card used for other Kigali buses, passengers access the quiet, connected comfort of R10 with WiFi & USB charging.
Digitally Powered Bus
With the R10,
operators can monitor the location and status of their bus at all times
though BasiGo's PAYD software.  PAYD also provides detailed data on the technical and operational performance of the bus every day.
Convenient, Reliable Charging
The R10 can be
fully charged in 2 hours
at BasiGo charging stations located next to bus operating routes. Through Pay-As-You-Drive, operators can trust in free and easy charging at BasiGo stations with high reliability power from REG.

The Problem
By 2025, Africa will have 10 mega-cities each with over 10 Million people. Diesel buses are the primary mode of transport in these cities accounting for 40% of all trips.  But meeting mobility needs of a growing population with more diesel buses poses an enormous challenge. Diesel tailpipe emissions already choke the air with toxic pollution. Dependence on diesel imports directly affects economic growth. All while diesel-powered buses further accelerate catastrophic climate change across the African continent. To keep pace with their own growth, African cities are in need of a sustainable mobility revolution.
The Opportunity
Africa is home to some of the most abundant clean energy in the world. Over 70% of the electricity in East Africa already comes from renewable sources such as hydropower, geothermal, solar, and wind. Replacing a diesel bus in East Africa with an electric bus has greater social, environmental, and climate impact than anywhere else in the world, all while saving bus owners money. Africa has the opportunity to become global leaders in the transition to inclusive, sustainable public transport.
Who are We?
Headquartered in Nairobi, BasiGo is starting a sustainable mobility revolution in African cities. We bring together experts in electric vehicles, public transport, the power sector, asset finance, software, and data science.

BasiGo Secures $42M in Funding to Scale Public Transport Electrification in Sub-Saharan Africa — BasiGO
BasiGo Secures $42M in Funding to Scale Public Transport Electrification in Sub-Saharan Africa
Oct 23
Written By
Dorcus Wanjiru Kamotho
The capital raised by BasiGo combines $24 Million in Series A equity funding and $17.5 Million in debt.
The Series A equity round has been led by Africa50 with co-investment from Novastar Ventures, CFAO Kenya, Mobility54, SBI Investment, Trucks VC, Moxxie Ventures, and Susquehanna Foundation.
The Series A funding satisfies a key commitment to unlocking the $10 million loan facility from
U.S. Development Finance Corporation (DFC)
for BasiGo Kenya.  It also unlocks an additional $7.5 million debt facility from
British International Investment (BII)
to scale BasiGo’s E-bus deployments in Rwanda
The capital will be put towards BasiGo’s objective of delivering 1,000 electric buses in East Africa in the next 3 years, while also enabling the company to expand to new vehicle types and new markets.
Nairobi, Kenya| October 23, 2024:
BasiGo, the leading provider of electric bus solutions in sub-Saharan Africa, has today announced the successful closing of a US$42 million in new capital.
The funding round consists of US$24 million in Series A equity funding along with US$17.5 million in debt facilities from British International Investment (BII) and the U.S. Development Finance Corporation (DFC). The equity funding round is led by Africa50, the pan-African infrastructure investor and asset manager, marking the most significant investment from an African fund in an e-mobility company.
The equity round features co-investments from Novastar Ventures, CFAO Kenya, Mobility54, SBI Investment, Trucks VC, Moxxie Ventures, and Susquehanna Foundation. The Series A equity round unlocks a $10 million debt facility from DFC for BasiGo Kenya, as well as a new $7.5 million debt facility from BII specifically designed for scaling BasiGo’s E-bus deployment in Rwanda.
Jit Bhattacharya, CEO of BasiGo remarked: “Since we founded BasiGo in 2021, our mission has been to create the future of clean, electric public transport in Africa. We are thrilled to have Africa50, a premier African infrastructure investment fund, recognize the potential of our mission. The combined equity and debt investment into BasiGo validates our business model and enables BasiGo to focus on scale and profitability. With BII's support to expand our E-bus model in Rwanda, we are ready to deliver hundreds of modern, emissions-free electric buses across East Africa.”
The capital raised by BasiGo will be put towards the company’s core objective of delivering 1,000 electric buses in East Africa within the next 3 years. In Kenya, the funds will specifically be used to increase manufacturing capacity at BasiGo’s dedicated E-Bus assembly line located at Kenya Vehicle Manufacturers.  The investment will also support the expansion of BasiGo’s Pay-As-You-Drive offering to new vehicle types, and to improve BasiGo's technology platforms such as Jani which make electric buses more accessible and convenient for passengers.
“We are delighted to conclude Africa50’s first investment in the e-mobility space to support the greening of the public transport sector in Kenya and Rwanda. We believe BasiGo is well positioned to scale in East Africa and beyond given its world class engineering and operations teams, strong value proposition to transport operators and the caliber of strategic and financial partners assembled by the founders,” said Raza Hasnani, Managing Director and Head of Infrastructure Investments at Africa50. “As the largest investment to date by an African fund in an e-mobility company, we are proud to support innovation that drives green growth and development in the region,” added Mr. Hasnani.
Steve Beck, Managing Partner at Novastar Ventures commented: “As an early investor in BasiGo, we are immensely proud of the team’s continued progress towards transforming the public bus transport sector in Africa - delivering improved experience for commuters and substantial environmental benefits. This latest funding round is a testament to the strong investor confidence in BasiGo’s business model, value proposition and customer demand as it expands its operations and leads the way in sustainable transportation in Africa. We are thrilled with this latest milestone and look forward to our continued partnership with BasiGo through the next phase of growth and beyond.”
In December 2023, BasiGo expanded its operations to Rwanda where it is currently operating 6 pilot electric buses on routes inside Kigali as well as inter-city routes serving nearby towns. The newest debt facility from BII will be put towards launching commercial deliveries of E-Buses in Rwanda, where BasiGo has already received over 300 reservations from bus operators.
Seema Dhanani, Head of Office, Kenya and Coverage Director, East Africa at BII, said: “We are delighted to support BasiGo as it expands into Rwanda. This marks a significant step in electrifying the local public transport sector, reducing pollution, and combating climate change impacts. This is in line with our priority of supporting e-mobility to foster sustainable economic growth.”
The total capital raised represents one of the most significant investments into Electric Mobility in Africa. The investment accelerates BasiGo’s growth trajectory and strengthens its position as a leader in Sub-Saharan Africa’s evolving EV landscape.

BasiGo Secures Financing from Rwanda Green Fund
Jul 9
Written By
Jit Bhattacharya
BasiGo Rwanda has been awarded a RWF 300 million (USD 225,000) recoverable grant from Ireme Invest, the Rwanda Green Fund’s green investment facility. The financing will be used by BasiGo to upgrade its charging infrastructure needed to support its rapidly growing fleet of electric public transport buses in Kigali. A charging station that supports at least 20 E-Buses in one night will be established.
In June 2024, the Rwanda Green Fund announced its first round of investments worth a total of $2.7 million into 16 different companies that are fostering a vibrant circular economy, promoting sustainable cities, supercharging smart mobility and advancing climate-smart agriculture.
"
We appreciate Rwanda Green Fund for recognising BasiGo as one of the key contributors to the country's ambitious climate action and sustainable development goals. As the market leader in electrifying Rwanda’s bus fleet, we are committed to delivering innovative and reliable Electric Bus solutions. Our BasiGo electric buses have over the last seven months of operation demonstrated the new standard for safe, comfortable, and low-carbon public transportation solutions and helped to reduce emissions
," said Doreen Orishaba, BasiGo Rwanda Managing Director.
Potential for scalability
BasiGo Rwanda is listed among nine innovative businesses offering solutions with high potential for scalability, financial sustainability, and positive environmental and economic impact across three of Ireme Invest’s investment areas. The funding was made possible through the support of the Danish International Development Agency and the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office.
According to a statement from the Rwanda Green Fund, BasiGo is among the companies contributing to the country's ambitious climate action and sustainable development goals.
Electrifying Rwanda
In December 2023, BasiGo introduced the R10 Rumuri, Kigali’s first fully electric bus with a capacity of 70 passengers. This aligns with the Government of Rwanda's initiative to rapidly scale Kigali’s public transport fleet while also aiming to convert 20 per cent of the public bus fleet to electric by 2030.
“
Rwanda has established itself as a leader in E-mobility on the African continent. Our experience and innovative Pay-As-You-Drive financing model are well-positioned to help Rwanda transition to fully electrified public transport, reducing fuel imports and helping Rwanda meet its ambitious greenhouse gas mitigation targets,
” said Jit Bhattacharya, CEO and Co-Founder of BasiGo.
As of July 2024, BasiGo E-buses in Kigali had registered:
▪ 107,000 Electric kilometres driven
▪ 385,125 passengers ferried
▪ >60 Tonnes of CO2 mitigated
▪ 26,662 liters of diesel avoided
▪ 100% uptime recorded
▪ > 147 million Rwandan Francs in fare revenue generated for the Operators.

INVESTMENTS, TRADE & INDUSTRY CABINET SECRETARY REBECCA MIANO LAUNCHES KENYA’S FIRST DEDICATED HIGH VOLUME ASSEMBLY LINE FOR ELECTRIC BUSES AT KENYA VEHICLE MANUFACTURERS (KVM), THIKA
Investments, Trade & Industry Cabinet Secretary Rebecca Miano has inaugurated
Kenya’s first
dedicated Electric Bus assembly line at the Kenya Vehicle Manufacturers plant in Thika.
BasiGo aims to locally assemble
1,000 buses over three years
,
creating over 300 green manufacturing jobs
.
BasiGo has already completed the assembly of two E9 Kubwa buses that are specifically designed for the Kenyan PSV market.
Nairobi, Kenya:
Investments, Trade & Industry Cabinet Secretary Rebecca Miano has today inaugurated BasiGo’s Electric Bus production line at the Kenya Vehicle Manufacturers plant in Thika. This is Kenya’s first dedicated assembly line for modern Electric Buses.
In February 2024, BasiGo completed the assembly of two E9 Kubwa buses, a 9-metre electric bus specifically designed for the Kenyan PSV market and poised to revolutionise public transport in Kenya.
“One of the key priorities of the Government is addressing climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The transport sector is a significant contributor to carbon emissions and transitioning to electric vehicles presents a sustainable solution to mitigate environmental degradation and address the negative effects of climate change,” said CS Miano.
During the event, CS Miano flagged off the first two E9 Kubwa buses that have been assembled at KVM. These buses will now enter operation with Citi Hoppa and Super Metro, both of whom are in the process of converting their fleet to electric buses.
“We thank the Government for supporting BasiGo as we scale electrification of public transport here in Kenya. The transition to clean, electric buses represents more than just impact on the environment.  It is an opportunity for Kenya to establish itself as a manufacturing hub for modern EV’s as well as the components that make up those vehicles. We are proud to support Kenya in taking the lead by inaugurating this first-of-its-kind E-Bus assembly line in partnership with KVM," said Jit Bhattacharya, CEO and Co-Founder of BasiGo.
The inauguration of the new line represents a significant step towards sustainability for Kenya's public transportation system.
CS Miano added: “The Government recognises the critical role that investment such as BasiGo plays in driving economic growth, creating employment opportunities and improving the livelihoods of our citizens. We have therefore prioritised the creation of a conducive business and investment climate, with robust policies besides streamlining regulations and setting up strategic incentives aimed at attracting and retaining investors.”
BasiGo plans to locally assemble 1,000 E-Buses for Kenyan bus operators over the next three years, an investment that will create 300 green manufacturing jobs in Kenya. Already, BasiGo has over 500 orders from bus operators in Nairobi and an additional 100 reservations from bus operators in Kigali, Rwanda.
“We have proven that local assembly is viable and impactful. Now, we urge policymakers to create an enabling environment that fosters innovation, job creation, and economic growth. Together, we can chart a brighter future for mobility in Kenya and Africa," added Moses Nderitu, the BasiGo Kenya Managing Director.

Kenya Vehicle Manufacturers (KVM) was the first assembly plant in Kenya. The other two are AVA Mombasa and Isuzu. Isuzu only produces for Isuzu.
Originally named Leyland Kenya, KVM’s first production off line was in August 1976. The plant was originally designed to produce light and heavy commercial vehicles. However, over time, production slowed down as Kenya’s economy declined, and KVM diversified into bus and truck body building.
In February 2024, the Kenya Government and Toyota Tsusho Corporation of Japan signed a framework agreement for collaboration in vehicle manufacturing. Toyota Tshusho committed KSh 800 million to revive KVM. Currently the Government of Kenya is the largest shareholder at KVM with a 35 percent stake while CMC and DT Dobie own 32.5 each respectively.

BasiGo Co-Founders signing agreement with Akira Wada, Managing Director of CFAO Kenya
Empowering East Africa's Electric Mobility
BasiGo,  a leading electric bus company, has secured a significant boost of $3  million (Sh396 million) in equity funding from the CFAO Group. This  strategic investment aims to accelerate the production and delivery of  electric buses in Kenya and Rwanda, marking a significant milestone in  the region's transition towards sustainable transportation solutions.
CFAO Group's Commitment to E-Mobility
With  operations spanning across 40 African countries, the CFAO Group boasts  Africa's premier automotive distribution network. Recognizing the  immense potential of e-mobility, CFAO has been actively investing in the  sector, recently launching the first dealership for BYD electric cars  in Kigali, Rwanda. Through Mobility54, its corporate venture capital  arm, CFAO is dedicated to fostering the growth of e-mobility startups  across East Africa, further solidifying its position as a key player in  the region's green transportation revolution.
Scaling Up Electric Bus Production
BasiGo's  ambitious goal is to deliver 1,000 locally assembled electric buses  within the next three years, paving the way for a greener and more  sustainable transportation ecosystem in Kenya and Rwanda. This  initiative is expected to create 300 green manufacturing jobs, driving  economic growth and fostering innovation in the region.
Meeting Growing Demand
The  recent infusion of funding will enable BasiGo to meet the increasing  demand for electric buses, with over 500 reservations already secured  from bus operators in Nairobi and an additional 100 reservations from  operators in Kigali, Rwanda. The company aims to fulfill part of the 600  buses that have been reserved, further solidifying its position as a  leader in the electric mobility space.
A Vision for Sustainable Development
Jit  Bhattacharya, Co-Founder and CEO of BasiGo, views this funding as a  crucial step in the company's expansion strategy across Africa. "As a  player in the energy and mobility industry in Africa, CFAO recognizes  the extraordinary opportunity for electric mobility to transform African  economies," said Bhattacharya, emphasizing the potential of e-mobility  to drive sustainable development and economic prosperity across the  continent.
Towards Carbon Neutrality
The  investment in BasiGo aligns with broader efforts to achieve carbon  neutrality in Kenya. In February 2024, Toyota Tsusho Corporation, CFAO  Group, and CFAO Motor Kenya joined forces to establish a green energy  value chain, aiming to support Kenya's transition to carbon neutrality.  By promoting the adoption of electric vehicles and green energy  solutions, these initiatives contribute to mitigating greenhouse gas  emissions and promoting environmental sustainability.
Pioneering Green Transportation
BasiGo's  electric buses have already made a significant impact, having driven  over 1.5 million kilometers in Kenya, carried over 2.1 million  passengers, and mitigated over 680 tons of greenhouse gas emissions.  With the completion of their first locally assembled electric buses,  BasiGo is poised to lead the charge towards a cleaner, greener future  for transportation in East Africa.
Commitment to Sustainable Growth
Akira  Wada, Managing Director of CFAO Kenya, emphasized the transformative  potential of this investment, stating, "Through this investment, we are  not only supporting the growth of the electric vehicle industry but also  contributing to the development of a sustainable green energy value  chain that will benefit communities across Africa." This commitment  underscores the shared vision of BasiGo and CFAO Group to drive  sustainable growth and prosperity across the region.

AMPERSAND  STARTUP


PAVING THE WAY FOR AFFORDABLE, LOWER-CARBON PUBLIC TRANSPORT


Ampersand is Africa’s first electric transport energy company with the longest track record of serving a commercial e-motorcycle fleet and battery swapping network at scale.
We are creating a world where motorcycle transport is cleaner and more profitable for its consumers than ever before.
Going electric will double a driver’s income now, and leapfrog Africa towards a zero carbon future.


AMPERSAND HAS A voided nearly 11,500 tons of emissions Powered over 150 million km Increased customers income by 45% per day
​
OUR CUSTOMERS
Our customers work hard.
They tend to be in their late 20’s - 30’s, work 6 days a week, for an average of 14 hours and covering up to 190km per day. Electric motorcycle drivers earn 45% more than with petrol bikes due to fuel and maintenance savings – They save40% a year on fuel. 


The income they generate typically supports 4.6 people on average in Rwanda and
3.8 people in Kenya.
Ampersand's solution is designed with taxi drivers' in mind. Our guiding philosophy is to offer drivers a motorcycle and energy that costs less to acquire and operate, outperforms their current setup in every way, and happens to be electric. Battery swaps are faster than refueling, cost less than a tank of petrol, and take the driver further. We take care of the batteries’ maintenance and financing is also available.
Ampersand's e-motos cost the same as petrol motorcycles to buy and finance, and half as much to power, meaning that by switching to electric customers can increase their take home pay by 45%
​
​
​
About
OUR TECHNOLOGY
Ampersand has developed a business model and technology that seamlessly fits drivers' operations. We have created a network of swap stations that allow drivers to access smart batteries as and when they need them.
​

WHO WE ARE
WHAT WE DO


BUILDING THE FUTURE OF ENERGY FOR TRANSPORT
Our business model and technology are designed to fit seamlessly with drivers' operations. Drivers access smart batteries on demand from the network of Ampersand swap stations.
​
​With our solution drivers enjoy the savings of e-mobility without the upfront cost, and risk of buying a lithium battery pack or increasing downtime while waiting for batteries to recharge.
Renting a charged battery from Ampersand saves drivers around 45% compared to fuel and oil changes. Each battery delivers around 350,000 km of range over its lifetime, and 50-110km per swap depending on the type of usage, the roads travelled, and weight carried. This means drivers need to swap out less frequently than drivers in East Africa typically refuel with petrol. It's all made possible by Ampersand's unique Amper-Ops connected network of smart batteries, swap stations, and a vehicle drivetrain tailored to our customers' needs and African roads.
​
HOW IT WORKS
1. Drivers purchase or leases a pay-as-you-drive Ampersand e-moto
2. Through Ampersand’s Driver App, they check when the battery is low and visit a battery swap station
3. In less than 2 minutes, Ampersand swaps out the depleted battery for a new one and the driver pays for the energy used
4. The driver continues their day, swapping when required

PASSIONATE ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE
Ampersand was founded to achieve a crucial tipping point in the fight against climate change: the world's first mass-market electric vehicle that costs less to acquire, maintain, and operate than a fuel vehicle.
Years of work have gone into identifying the right market and designing the vehicle and business model hand in hand with our users to get the right fit.
We make the electric option the obvious choice for our customers by putting serious money back into the pockets of drivers and their families.
In the process, we help propel the EV industry to scale and prove to the world that the fuel age is over and electric mobility is for everyone.




OUR CUSTOMER


Right now, there are 22 million commercial motorcycles in Africa. Moto-taxis effectively navigate congestion while transporting 100M people in East Africa every day.
​
Many drivers spend over $11 daily on fuel and vehicle leasing costs but take home as little as $1.60 each day.
Ampersand can save customers 45% of their savings compared to internal combustion engine motorcycles.
​
REDUCING EMISSIONS


Ampersand’s e-motos cost less than petrol ones to lease or buy and half as much to power. They produce 75% less lifecycle greenhouse emissions than petrol motorbikes using grid power and up to 97% less using renewables.
​
Our battery packs are built to our own design and are assembled by our constantly expanding team in Rwanda.
​
MEET OUR CUSTOMERS
With the Ampersand
e-moto, maintenance costs are lower as we don’t need chain and oil which cost a lot. Now I benefit more from my income and I am able to start saving.
Gitwaza


Working with Ampersand is a great opportunity for me as apart from their innovation they care about our personal life. They helped us during the lock-down and are flexible in terms of contracts.

This strategic expansion enables it to meet the rapidly increasing demand for electric motorcycles in the country, where over 1,100 Ampersand e-motos are already in operation.
The new factory spans 21,000 square metres, making it over three times larger than the previous 6,500 square metre site. This significant upgrade, coupled with the deployment of over 100 staff, will allow Ampersand to assemble up to 60 electric motorcycles per day, or 1,440 per month, as well as to continue delivering the most trusted battery swap network for Kenya's millions of commercial motorcycle riders.
Ampersand’s sustainable EV solutions cut carbon emissions and offer significant savings to riders. Every Ampersand e-moto avoids at least 2 mt CO2e per bike per year and, on average, increases customer income by 45% annually, a vital benefit for Kenyan riders, who each support an average of 3.8 people at home.
The enhanced Kenyan operation, combined with Ampersand’s successful model in Rwanda where it has spearheaded the adoption of electric motorcycles, lays a strong foundation for its continued expansion across East Africa. Currently, Ampersand’s fleet of heavy-duty commercial e-motos and smart, AI-optimised battery fleet covers over 4.5 million kilometres per week in Kigali and Nairobi combined. This latest scaling positions the company to meet the growing demand for electric motorcycles, not just in Kenya but across East Africa, where 100 million people depend on largely petrol motorcycles for taxi or delivery services. Ampersand aims to deploy 5 million electric motorcycles by 2033.
Josh Whale, CEO, Ampersand, said:
“Our new Nairobi factory is a major step forward in both scale and impact. It reflects our dedication to providing sustainable, affordable EV solutions that directly benefit riders and the environment. With this expanded capacity, we’re in a stronger position to support the electrification of Africa’s commercial motorcycle transport and to scale Ampersand’s proven business model.”

​
Additional equity investment from three investors brings annual funding total to $21.5m
AHL Venture Partners and Everstrong Capital back Ampersand’s model with new investments, with Beyond Capital Ventures making a further investment
Funding comes ahead of the forthcoming Series B round
Kigali, 29 August 2024
– Africa’s leading EV energy tech company, Ampersand, has raised further equity bringing the funding total raised in the last 12 months to USD $21.5 million, demonstrating continued investor appetite for the company’s approach to electrifying Africa’s millions of motorcycles.
The latest investments are from AHL Venture Partners, an Africa-focused venture fund, and Everstrong Capital, an infrastructure investor constructing the Usahihi toll road between Nairobi and Mombasa. Beyond Capital Ventures has reinvested in a follow-up to its Series A equity commitment.
These additional investments, ahead of Ampersand’s Series B, will enable the company to continue its expansion in East Africa where 100 million people a day use motorcycle taxi or delivery services, called ‘boda bodas’. The company’s electric motorcycles are 45% cheaper to run than the petrol alternatives and produce at least 75% less emissions, making them a compelling alternative.
Josh Whale, CEO, Ampersand, said:
“This latest funding is a testament to the strong investor confidence in our business model as we continue to scale and innovate within the African e-mobility sector. With continued urbanisation, our mission to electrify transport, cut carbon emissions and drive clean economic prosperity is more crucial than ever.
“This additional investment will accelerate the rollout of our EV energy technology and infrastructure to the mass market, bringing us closer to our goal of deploying 5 million electric motorcycles by 2033.
“As we look ahead to our upcoming Series B, we remain committed to reshaping how Africa moves by delivering affordable, low-carbon transport solutions that also drive green jobs and economic growth across the continent.”
Ampersand’s heavy-duty commercial motorcycle fleet already covers 3,000,000 km per week in Kigali and Nairobi. Its AI-enabled smart battery technology allows drivers to seamlessly exchange their batteries within minutes at its network of ‘swap stations’, handling around 75,000 swaps every week.
Sebastian McKinlay, Head of New Investments, AHL Venture Partners, commented
:
"Ampersand's performance shows the transformative power of innovative business models in addressing environmental challenges and economic opportunities simultaneously - a perfect example of the 'green discount' of transitioning to a low carbon economy whilst saving customers money.
“Ampersand’s work in electrifying one of the most common forms of transportation in East Africa is proving to be a game-changer and will displace billions of dollars of fuel imports to East Africa each year.  We are pleased to be supporting Josh, Alp, and the whole team who have executed their strategy admirably, and thrilled to support Ampersand's journey to expand their operations and continue to lead the way in sustainable transportation."
Eva Yazhari, Managing Partner, Beyond Capital Ventures, said:
“Ampersand’s comprehensive approach to e-mobility in Africa exemplifies exactly the type of highly scalable solution Beyond Capital Ventures seeks to invest in. Among the e-mobility companies we evaluated, Ampersand stood out for its robust technology, strong market traction, and clear vision for transforming transportation networks across the continent. We view Ampersand as a climate
and
infrastructure play and by backing Ampersand, BCV's primary goal is to contribute to increased economic development and the growth of capital markets in the region.
“This investment has the potential to deliver substantial environmental benefits, improve livelihoods for thousands of drivers, and demonstrate the incredible opportunity to invest in ventures led by conscious leaders in emerging markets. In addition to being a strong portfolio contributor, I believe that Ampersand’s success will attract further investment to Africa, something we care deeply about at BCV."
Phil Dyk, Founder and Managing Partner, Everstrong Capital, said:
“We chose to be part of Ampersand’s growth capital because we found that commercial boda boda riders wanted Ampersand’s bikes for their strength, design and battery swapping convenience — not to mention that Ampersand is an early entrant to the electric motorcycle markets in Rwanda and Kenya.”
Capital raised from the Series A round has been used to
ramp up electric motorcycle and battery production, expand the company’s swap station network, and continue R&D on battery technology and software.
This latest funding round brings the total raised over the last 12 months to USD $14 million in equity and USD $7.5 million in debt.

As its primary supplier, Ampersand will purchase BYD’s high-tech battery cells to build around 40,000 electric motorcycles by the end of 2026, with the long-term goal of electrifying a large portion of Africa’s 30 million commercial motorbikes.
The partnership with BYD will enable Ampersand to rapidly scale its electric fleet and its charging infrastructure, which is already the largest in Rwanda and Kenya. This continued scaling will allow Ampersand to meet the increasing demand for commercial motorcycles across Africa as its cities expand and riders increase, providing a sustainable solution to support the continent’s economic growth.
Josh Whale, CEO of Ampersand, said:
“
This partnership marks a major milestone for Ampersand as we continue to lead the charge in providing sustainable, cost effective, mass-market EV solutions.
“BYD’s world-leading battery cells and manufacturing scale, combined with Ampersand’s deep customer insight and technical product knowledge will help fast-track the electrification of Africa’s commercial motorcycles.
“Switching the millions of taxi and delivery two-wheelers to EV energy tech represents one of the world’s best value-for-money decarbonisation opportunities. At the same time, this transformation will save millions of hardworking motorcycle riders six hundred dollars each a year, driving clean economic prosperity.”
BYD’s cutting-edge lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells have a long lifespan, an excellent safety record and are affordable for everyday users, making them ideal for mass-market electrification.
Sihai Zhang, BYD Company, said:
“Ampersand’s electric motorbike technology and charging network, along with its excellent customer understanding, make the company stand out to BYD as the clear pioneer in the electrification of Africa’s transport system.
“Electrifying the intensively used commercial motorcycles found across Africa is a logical first step to decarbonising a very large potential market of motorcycles across the Global South.”
At the same time as decarbonising transport, electric two-wheelers clean up the air and save drivers on average 45% a year on fuel and maintenance, improving lives and livelihoods - driving entrepreneurship and social mobility.

New Zealand Foreign Affairs Minister inaugurates Ampersand E-Motorbike Battery Swap Station in Kigali, Rwanda
On her recent visit to Rwanda for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, Hon. Nanaia Mahuta, New Zealand’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, officially inaugurated the 13th battery swap station for
Ampersand
, a Kigali-based energyand electric motorbike company. The Minister was welcomed by the Ampersand team led by Josh Whale, CEO and Founder - a citizen of New Zealand who moved to Rwanda to put Africa's first electric motorbikes on the road.
Located in Kigali’s CBD, the station was funded by the New Zealand Government through the New Zealand Aid Programme and is one of ten stations across the city which power more than 370 e-motorbikes, and the first of a next-generation design. The battery swap stations enable drivers to replace their depleted batteries in under two minutes. This means drivers can spend more time on the road and earn more money.
Speaking at the inauguration, Ampersand CEO Josh Whale thanked the government and community of New Zealand for supporting Ampersand to electrify Africa’s mobility industry.
“We are very grateful to the New Zealand Government for their trust in our vision and commitment. Ampersand believes in a future where motorbike transport is cleaner, safer, and more affordable. Every new bike, and every new station added to our growing network is a stepping stone on our journey to success. It's fantastic that New Zealand sees the potential of Ampersand to create a low-carbon future in Africa,” said Josh.
On behalf of the New Zealand Government, Minister Nanaia Mahuta said that she is proud of the work Ampersand is doing and highlighted that the company’s solution reduces the reliance on fossil fuels, which is good for the environment and creates employment opportunities. The Foreign Affairs Minister commended the impact Ampersand is having in achieving a green and sustainable future, and wished the team all the best for future ventures.
Ampersand has built 10 battery swap stations in Kigali and three in Nairobi, Kenya. These stations perform close to 37,000 battery swaps a month, providing energy that already powers its customers over four times the length of Africa every day. Ampersand has already created hundreds of green jobs for young people.
The swap station features a mural that depicts what Ampersand does, celebrates New Zealand’s Māori culture and picturesque landscapes, as well as some of Rwanda’s tourist attractions. The mural was painted by Masha, a Rwanda based street artist.

PRESS RELEASE - Ampersand Secures $9 Million USD debt facility from the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) to Scale Operations
​
KIGALI
—Ampersand Rwanda Ltd, Africa’s first electric motorcycle company, has just secured a $9 million loan facility from the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) to expand its operations in Rwanda and Kenya. The deal represents DFC’s first loan for electric mobility and signifies increasing investor confidence in Africa’s rising e-mobility sector.
Headquartered in Kigali, Rwanda, Ampersand assembles and finances electric motorcycles (‘emotos’ or ‘e-bodas’) that cost less to buy and operate, and perform better than the 5 million petrol motorcycle taxis in use across East Africa - all with up to 83% less carbon emissions. The core of Ampersand’s business is the network of battery swap stations and fleet of batteries Ampersand builds and operates. This system allows drivers to swap batteries faster than refilling a tank with petrol and shields vehicle buyers from the high upfront cost of a lithium battery pack. Since its commercial launch in May 2019, Ampersand’s team has performed over 50,000 battery swaps, powering Ampersand’s fleet of 56 drivers for over 2 million kilometers.
DFC’s $9 Million USD loan will allow Ampersand to scale up the number of electric motorcycles on the road in Rwanda and Kenya to several thousand by the end of 2022. The loan is part of DFC’s Portfolio for Impact and Innovation (PI²) initiative and contributes to DFC’s commitment to the U.S. Energy Compact and its target to address climate change with one third of its investments by 2023.
DFC’s facility builds on a $4 Million USD Series A round Ampersand secured earlier in 2021, which was supported by Silicon Valley investor Ecosystem Integrity Fund (EIF) and TotalEnergies. DFC’s investment also builds on early-stage support Ampersand received from USAID’s Development Innovation Ventures (DIV), Rwanda’s Green Fund and the UK Government’s Frontier Technology Livestreaming initiative, among others.
“We’re thrilled to have DFC on board with this historic investment, which is building momentum to electrify all of East Africa’s 5 million motorcycle taxis by 2030. DFC’s support underlines the viability and investability of electric two wheelers for mass-market customers in the Global South, and the importance of this market to reaching net zero. On the eve of COP26 in Glasgow we believe more bold, fast-moving and innovative funds like PI² are urgently needed,” says
Josh Whale, Founder and CEO of Ampersand


“DFC is proud to support Ampersand in their important and innovative work bringing e-mobility and electric motorcycles to Rwanda and Kenya,” said DFC’s Chief Climate Officer Jake Levine. “DFC is focused on making impactful investments in developing countries that will help communities progress and grow while simultaneously building resilience and prosperity for a clean energy future -- this investment and the incredible growth that Ampersand has demonstrated in the market represents a great step in that direction.”
